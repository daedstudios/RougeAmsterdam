          where raw energy meets hypnotic beats. A haven for techno lovers,
          ROUGE is more than just a club; it's an immersive experience of deep
          bass, pulsating lights, and an electrifying atmosphere. Rooted in the
          underground scene, we bring together cutting-edge sound,
          boundary-pushing artists, and a crowd that lives for the rhythm. Step
          inside, lose yourself, and let the night take over.
