        where raw energy meets hypnotic beats. A haven for techno lovers, ROUGE
        is more than just a club; it's an immersive experience of deep bass,
        pulsating lights, and an electrifying atmosphere. Rooted in the
        underground scene, we bring together cutting-edge sound,
        boundary-pushing artists, and a crowd that lives for the rhythm. Step
        inside, lose yourself, and let the night take over.
